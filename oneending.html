    <p class="higherstate1" href="eps.html"> MENTIONING PAST RELATIONSHIPS, ARGUMENTS BETWEEN LOVED ONES, DRUG ABUSE, AND MORE, "ONEENDING" IS MORE PERSONAL COMPARED TO THE OTHERS IN THE 
        CURRENT DISCOGRAPHY. THIS SONG IS UNIQUE IN ITS OWN WAY, UTILIZING LESS OF A MELODIC ESSENCE, AND REMOVING THE 808S TO MAKE ROOM FOR PEOPLE TO PAY ATTENTION TO THE LYRICS MORESO THAN
        THE VIBE.
